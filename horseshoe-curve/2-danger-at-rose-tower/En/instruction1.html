		<br>ERS15 8572 with hoppers is in front of Rose Tower on your track ahead of you, without an engineer.  Couple to it then reverse it back so your engine is at the safe distance where an engineer is waiting, that will be far enough, then await further instruction. I am counting on you to make the area safe.

		<P>
		<br>You may exceed yard speed limits, up to 40MPH, but beware of high speeds over switches and of coupling too fast as that remains a danger to yourself and others.
