		<P>You can now exit Juniata and get to Slope.  You won't need to set any more switches.  You'll pass by Altoona passenger station before arriving at Slope Yard.  </P>
		<P>Stop as close to Ted Jennings as you can, he's working at Slope today and had been told to keep an eye out for your arrival.  Tell him Jones sent you!</P>
