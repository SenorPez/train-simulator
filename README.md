# Train Simulator Classic 2024

This repository holds fixes for [Train Simulator Classic 2024](https://train-simulator.com/gb) from [Dovetail Games](https://dovetailgames.com/).

Due to simulation engine changes and other factors, some Career Mode scenarios included with Train Simulator Classic can not be completed with the maximum 1000 points, regardless of player skill. In many cases these issues will never be fixed. Luckily, one of the features of Train Simulator Classic is a robust editor which, when combined with a bit of file manipulation, allows for some of these errors to be corrected.
