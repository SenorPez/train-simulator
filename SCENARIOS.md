## Feeling the Heat
**Problem:** The scoring for the scenario totals less than 1000 points. Only 900 total points are available, and some of those are often lost due to a forced late arrival.

**Solution:** The three scoring stops have been updated to a total of 1000 points. The forced late arrival has been adjusted.
